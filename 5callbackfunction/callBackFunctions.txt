A callback is simply a function that passed in as a parameter to another function and than it ran inside the function body, a function which is called inside the forEach loop is actually a callback.
we have synchronous and asynchronous callbacks.
setTimeOut is actually a callback function, its a synchronous callback.

here is mimic  the action of creating a blogposton a server or through an API or dataBase. we are only using a hardcodded array but we are going to pretend that it's from a server and also getting those blogpost back.
now in some cases the server may return the post before your new post is added and your new post wont be included. even we created a new post by running the create post function before GET post, we will learn how the mess things up by using setTimeOut.
