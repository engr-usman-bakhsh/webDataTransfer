//singleton pattern is actually the manifestation of module pattern
// a singleton object is an immediate anonymous function and it can only return one instance on an object at a time, so repeated call to the constructor will just return the same instance and like the module pattern it also has privaten variables and functions which cannot be accesed from outside 

// why we may want to use a singleton object?
// we may be only want for instance one user object created at a time may be a logged in user, it would prevent you from having two users from being created at once.
// often time singleton are frowned upon because they give you a global point of access rather than embracing and encapsulation and that bothers a lot of programmers and they also be a kind of hard to debug, 
// he said may be singleton may have its place but he didnot used it too much


const singleton = (function() {
    let instance;

    function createInstance() {
        // this is not a very practical example
        const object = new Object({ name: 'usman' });
        return object;
    }
    return {
        getInstance: function() {
            if (!instance) {
                instance = createInstance()
            }
            return instance
        }
    }
})();

const instanceA = singleton.getInstance();
// if i instantiate another object from singleton?
const instanceB = singleton.getInstance();

console.log(instanceA === instanceB)
    // console.log(instanceA)
