// All programming languages have design patterns that are used in wide variety of situations. following explanation is going to be very generalized

// What is a pattern?
// a pattern ia a re-usable solution that can be applied in occuring problems in software design(in this case its JavaScript).
// patterns can also be thought of as programming templates(a way to create a specific way for writing code)
// Situations vary significantly
// some patterns like factory and prototype patterns are used for object creation.
// the module pattern and all of its variations are used for overall structure/
// we have complete software design patterns like MVC which is the model view controller pattern and these can apply to whole applications or to just little blocks of code.
// its a very broad subject
// we are already using some patterns like constructor pattern or prototype pattern
// // here is a list of some patterns with some introduction

    // module pattern
    // revealing module pattern

// these patters are used for overall structure, it allows us to break our code to modules, or we can have private functions and variables and public functions and variables 

    // Singleton
  
// it is a kind of a variation of module pattern, where we can only create one instance of an object

    // factory Pattern.
  
// this is used to create many many objects 

    // Observer pattern

// is used to basically subscribe and unsubscribe to an event

    // mediator pattern

// whic kind of has a central mediator than it has colleagues that separate off from it,

    // State pattern

// it allows us to have a certain state in our application and we can change that state
